# Dhalion
_In Greek mythology, the Dhalion is a bird that is said to be able to take the sickness away from a person and into itself. Then it flies away, dispersing the sickness and healing both itself and the sick person._

Dhalion is a framework for automatically scaling and tuning distributed systems.
